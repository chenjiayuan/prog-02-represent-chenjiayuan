Represent! is an application for voters to check the information of the congressional representatives of a given location. It also encorporates android wear manipulation for browsing informations. Start off by choosing how to find congress members: by zipcode or by your current location. Represent! is a homework of C260A UI Design, implemented by Jiayuan Chen

Core functionalities:

* The Main View (mobile) allow users to input a zip code/current location, and open both a Congressional View on the phone and a Main View on the watch with the appropriate information
* Can swipe through a list of congressional representatives on the watch
* Selecting a member of congress on the watch change the Detailed View on the phone
* Changing the location result in a change in the results of the 2012 Vote View
* Changing the accelerometer value of the watch (to simulate a shake) randomly select a location in the US, updating information accordingly
